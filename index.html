                        <p> Everything was used to be so perfect for Dean Cornelius Ortigoza. From an up and coming rock and roll career to supportive significant others...sa murang edad ay kulang na lang at lalagpasan na niya ang mga pangarap. Mga pangarap nila. One more step to get ahold of his dreams. All in just one single reach.

                            Just one more...until a requisition of vow became a misstep that took a three hundred and sixty degree turn. Inside out. 
                            
                            Hearts are breaking.
                            Promises undone.
                            A heart turned cold.
                            The day he became ruthless. </p>

                            Dumating man ang araw na tanaw ko na ang dulo. 
                            
                            Dumating man ang araw na wala na kaming sagot sa lahat ng bakit at paano.

                            <p> Whenever I was with her, I could hear my unfamiliar laughter. I could see the nostalgic glint in my eyes. I could feel the warmth that illuminated my heart. 
                                for the first time in a long time, I was free. I was happy. She was the one who kept me going-- my DOSAGE OF SEROTONIN. </p>

                        <p>Elora Chin Valencia grew up in a toxic Christian family where she was viewed as the black sheep. Araw-araw ay ipinaparamdam sa kanya ng mundo na wala siyang lugar sa sarili niyang tahanan. 
                            She was a consistent dean's lister and an obedient daughter, which left her wondering what she had done so wrong to be disregarded as a speck of dust in the wind. They made her feel like she was just dirt,
                             filling up the empty space. The one who would never have her own safe place. But for the first time in her life, she had proven her family wrong---a happy Elora Chin was possible. She was loved and well-taken care of. Troy embraced her sharp parts, not minding the wounds he might get.

                             But fate had a lot of cruel things in store for her.
                             
                             Because when she thought she  had reached the peak of happiness, she found herself drowning alone in the ocean she now called home, alone in her shame, alone with the waves she couldn't tame.</p>
